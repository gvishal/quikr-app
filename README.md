Idea Name: Quik-Drop
Introduction
Quikr is a very good platform to gather visibility for your products, both new and old. Retailers can post their ad and “quikly” gain new customers. But, selling on quikr involves a lot of manual work for the seller viz, he needs to manage the negotiations for each individual customer. Also payment and delivery channels are not clearly defined.

In a nutshell,
Quikr has great:
Visibility
Back-end 
for ads.
It Doesn’t:
Streamline the flow for sellers and buyers.
Involve any Payment and delivery channels.

Our Solution
Typically, the retailer is ready to give out discounts if many buyers purchase a product. So we have a concept of price drop wherein if a stipulated no of users buy a product they will get it a price lower than the norm. Also, (In future) payment and delivery can be done through our platform. So, all the hassles of visibility, payment and delivery are solved by combining quikr and quik-drop.

Workflow
What a retailer has to do is post an ad on our platform, this ad is also posted on quikr (through their api) along with a link to the quik-drop product page in the ad description on quikr. On our platform the user has 2 options:
Buy the product at the normal price, or
Commit to buying the product
If the required no of users commit to buying the product, the price will drop and everybody will benefit from it.
